                                   <h2><b>Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX - Leading the way. For over 1,000 kilometres.</b></h2>
                                   <p>
                                        Mercedes-Benz is setting new standards for electric range and efficiency
                                        with the VISION EQXX. The prototype demonstrates just how efficient,
                                        sustainable and luxurious electromobility can be. This champion of efficiency
                                        has a range of more than 1,000 kilometres on a single battery charge, which equates
                                        to consumption of less than 10 kWh of energy per 100 kilometres. This is due in part
                                        to the exterior design and aerodynamics, which achieve a benchmark drag coefficient
                                        of 0.17. The irresistible bodywork takes the revolution further: the VISION EQXX
                                        demonstrates precisely what will make an electric vehicle a Mercedes-Benz in the
                                        future, with lightweight design, battery innovations and new materials.

                                   The advanced design studios are creative spaces where the designers can let their thoughts roam freely without thinking of a series production right away. In Carlsbad, California, designers are creating the exteriors of show cars, concept cars, and mobility concepts for tomorrow and beyond. The location is subject to the influences of the typical Californian lifestyle and to the proximity to Hollywood. As a result, Carlsbad is home to a very special form or creativity, which also leaves its marks on the design of the Mercedes-Benz production models, and opens up new perspectives.
